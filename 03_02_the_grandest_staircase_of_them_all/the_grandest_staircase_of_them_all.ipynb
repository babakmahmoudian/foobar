    "With the LAMBCHOP doomsday device finished, Commander Lambda is preparing to debut on the galactic stage -- but in order to make a grand entrance, Lambda needs a grand staircase! As the Commander's personal assistant, you've been tasked with figuring out how to build the best staircase EVER. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda has given you an overview of the types of bricks available, plus a budget. You can buy different amounts of the different types of bricks (for example, 3 little pink bricks, or 5 blue lace bricks). Commander Lambda wants to know how many different types of staircases can be built with each amount of bricks, so they can pick the one with the most options. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of staircase should consist of 2 or more steps.  No two steps are allowed to be at the same height - each step must be lower than the previous one. All steps must contain at least one brick. A step's height is classified as the total amount of bricks that make up that step.\n",
    "For example, when N = 3, you have only 1 choice of how to build the staircase, with the first step having a height of 2 and the second step having a height of 1: (# indicates a brick)\n",

    "A. There's a reason for decreasing 1 option from the final result (for example count(1, n) - 1). It is the scenario of 1 stair which utilizes all the bricks, which's a valid sub-problem according to your Top Down state-definition. It's being removed in retrospect, due to the following constraint: \"Every staircase consists of at least two steps\".\n",
    "\n",
    "B. You provided a state-definition to the Top Down approach, however the Bottom Up approach lacks such definition. They aren't equal by any means, the bottom up state-definition is more confusing:\n",
    "m[last][left] represents the amount of options to build a staircase, s.t. its last step is equal or smaller than 'last', utilizing exactly 'left' bricks. The smaller or equal attribute means, that states aren't disjoint, i.e. there are intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Still regarding the Bottom Up approach. It's better be clarified (i.e. logical proof), especially since the state-definition is accumulative:\n",
    "* Addition I: m[last][left] = m[last - 1][left]:\n",
    "Each sub-problem having last (rightmost) step height of 'last - 1' at most, which utilizes exactly 'left' bricks, should be counted. In reference to B, because the state definition is accumulative.\n",
    "* Addition II: m[last][left] += m[last - 1][left - last]:\n",
    "Each sub-problem with max height of 'last - 1' (possibly less), which utilizes exactly 'left - last' bricks, can be expanded by adding 1 more stair of height 'last' (it will be the rightmost of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Still regarding the Bottom Up approach:\n",
    "\"The running time ... is a little bit slower than for the custom memoization implementation. In the bottom-up approach, all the states are visited (2 for-loops => 500 ** 2 = 250000 states). In the top-down approach, only the states that are needed are computed\"\n",
    "Well, this is actually up to you, and the confusion comes from lack of well-defined state. Notice that your nested loop visits irrelevant states, in which last > left (impossible to build even 1 step of height last, if you have less than last bricks). In fact, for any last > left, we know that:\n",
    "m[last][left] = m[left][left]\n",
    "i.e. increasing last any higher than left, cannot add more (accumulated) options. Wrapping up all that, the bottom-up approach will be faster than top-down (due to no function stack calls), if we replace the nested loop\n",
